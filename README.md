# source{d} paper reading club

Discuss papers at the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Machine
Learning communities related to applications of Machine Learning to Code.


## Goal

- promote reading papers
- rise awareness on current research directions in PL, SW, ML communities
- create opportunity for collaborations


## How it works

Every 2 weeks we pick and discuss a paper.

Next paper is chosen from a list of candidates established at the end of the session.

Anyone can comment on a paper's PDF on [GDrive][GDrive] with questions or things that are worth
clarifying.


## Next sessions

- __2018.12.14__ at __4PM CET__. We'll study [Improving Automatic Source Code Summarization via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1f8EbbpK7xJn3lYMGqQH_vpz135M40ndY). A public [GDoc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gLpc1j-W5t90xxjqj7BZvW3DZzbDTpkFXLxv03B6Tp8) is available to write down any question you'd like to discuss during the reading club.
